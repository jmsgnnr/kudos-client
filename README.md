## Development process
As far as planning goes, I ran into a huge PATH error with running node for grunt serve. I had to set up my logic for the randomGen function inside a codepen to make sure it was working . I knew the structure from my previous front end practices would hold up, but getting my logic to work inside my code in a short time was definetely the biggest obstacle I had to overcome. 



## Unsolved problems

I still need to implement the userQuotes feature and figure out how to add the user added quotes into the quotes array to randomize. I would like to make some box-shadow changes to css as well to make it pop more, as well as add a delete button .
