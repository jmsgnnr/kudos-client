## Development process
Structuring the front end using the technologies listed above, I knew the logic behind implementing my "randomizer" function , I wanted a user experience that would allow a user to view a random positive quote after feeling the stress of coding . Enter Po$i-Bot, a clickable bot that provides user with a positive quote upon click displayed in HTML. In vol.2 , user will be able to add to an array of quotes and edit and delete.

## Unsolved problems

In my revised version of the app, I will implement a userQuotes array with an update and delete feature, using my randomizer method, and allow users to view their specific quotes in a seperate pop up menu .
