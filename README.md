## Development process
Structuring the front end using the technologies listed above, I knew the logic behind implementing my "randomizer" function , I wanted a user experience that would allow a user to view a random positive quote after feeling the stress of coding . Enter Po$i-Bot, a clickable bot that provides user with a positive quote upon click displayed in HTML. In the future, I plan on making a user array and a set array feature, with focus on having users/set quotes that are targeted towards destressing during code projects.
